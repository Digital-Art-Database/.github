<!-- 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction -->The Digital Art Database (DADB) is a place that collects and curates different forms of Digital Art and events from a range of different artists, companies, and collectives, to be able to have everything stored in one place. This idea to create a website/database stemmed from the frustration of having different things stored in different places, in the form of spreadsheets, bookmarks, articles, and various other places, so to eliminate that problem, this website stores everything from various sources in one easily accessible place.
